== README

This is a simple REST service that covers basic users and authentication. Each user has a relation to the stats that contain stats data. Login is mapped to '/login', stats can be updated with a POST request to '/stats'.

It was made for a Hackapong android game which was a Dragonhack 2016 project. Since hackapong is a two player game '/stats' accepts two user ids and two sets of scores.

Root is wired to show the leaderboard, live demo is available at https://hackapong.herokuapp.com
